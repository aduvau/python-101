# Tooling

These are tools we are going to use during the project. Some will be useful for any project you have, others are more specific to the project but will give you a reference of what you can expect with an API documentation for example.

## REPLs

- [Replit](https://replit.com/): free but you need an account
- [Python Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/repl/): free and easily accessible
- Type `python` or `python3` in your terminal to access a free REPL
- VSCode has a nice Python REPL included. Type `Cmd / Win` + `Shift` + `P` to access command line and search for Python REPL, then select "Python: Start Native Python REPL"

## External libraries

- [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) to search for a particular lib
- Looking for "A Python library that does that and that" and don't know the name? => [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/). Ask it to give you several alternatives, with pros and cons, given your needs and your skills

## APIs

- [RESTful APIs status codes](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/): infos about status codes you can have from a REST API
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/): the API fetching library we are using

## Session toolkit

- [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API): the API we are working with
